## Rubric Points
###Here I will consider the [rubric points](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/481/view) individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.

###Writeup / README

####1. Provide a Writeup / README that includes all the rubric points and how you addressed each one. You can submit your writeup as markdown or pdf. You can use this template as a guide for writing the report. The submission includes the project code.

You're reading it! and here is a link to my [project code](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Traffic-Sign-Classifier-Project/blob/master/Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb)

###Data Set Summary & Exploration

####1. Provide a basic summary of the data set. In the code, the analysis should be done using python, numpy and/or pandas methods rather than hardcoding results manually.

I used the pandas library to calculate summary statistics of the traffic
signs data set:

* The size of training set is 34799
* The size of the validation set is 4410
* The size of test set is 12630
* The shape of a traffic sign image is (32, 32, 3)
* The number of unique classes/labels in the data set is 43

####2. Include an exploratory visualization of the dataset.

Here is an exploratory visualization of the data set. It is a bar chart showing how the data ...

###Design and Test a Model Architecture

####1. Describe how you preprocessed the image data. What techniques were chosen and why did you choose these techniques? Consider including images showing the output of each preprocessing technique. Pre-processing refers to techniques such as converting to grayscale, normalization, etc. (OPTIONAL: As described in the "Stand Out Suggestions" part of the rubric, if you generated additional data for training, describe why you decided to generate additional data, how you generated the data, and provide example images of the additional data. Then describe the characteristics of the augmented training set like number of images in the set, number of images for each class, etc.)

As a first step, I decided to follow simple steps for preprocessing. I normalized the images and shuffled them. This caused the accuracy to jump from 87% to 93%.  

//Here is an example of a traffic sign image before and after grayscaling.

As a last step, I normalized the image data and equalized histograms in each image so that it can have uniform intensity. This will help the model to learn better. This increased my accuracy to 95%+.

//I decided to generate additional data because ... 

//To add more data to the the data set, I used the following techniques because ... 

//Here is an example of an original image and an augmented image:

The difference between the original data set and the augmented data set is the following ... 


####2. Describe what your final model architecture looks like including model type, layers, layer sizes, connectivity, etc.) Consider including a diagram and/or table describing the final model.

My final model consisted of the following layers:

| Layer         		|     Description	        					| 
|:---------------------:|:---------------------------------------------:| 
| Input         		| 32x32x3 RGB image   							| 
| Convolution 3x3     	| 1x1 stride, valid padding, outputs 32x32x6 	|
| RELU					|												|
| Max pooling	      	| 2x2 stride,  outputs 16x16x64 				|
| Convolution 3x3	    | 1x1 stride, valid padding, outputs 32x32x6	|
| RELU					|												|
| Max pooling	      	| 2x2 stride,  outputs 16x16x64 				|
| Fully connected		| etc.        									|
| RELU					|												|
| Dropout				|												|
| Softmax				| etc.        									|
|						|												|
|						|												|
 


####3. Describe how you trained your model. The discussion can include the type of optimizer, the batch size, number of epochs and any hyperparameters such as learning rate.

To train the model, I used an adam optimizer with 0.001 learning rate. The batch size 64 and number of epochs=40 gave me validation accuracy of 95%. 

####4. Describe the approach taken for finding a solution and getting the validation set accuracy to be at least 0.93. Include in the discussion the results on the training, validation and test sets and where in the code these were calculated. Your approach may have been an iterative process, in which case, outline the steps you took to get to the final solution and why you chose those steps. Perhaps your solution involved an already well known implementation or architecture. In this case, discuss why you think the architecture is suitable for the current problem.

LeNet architecture is best suited for this project because it uses deep neural networks and shines when you have lots of data and compute power. With some modifications like adding dropout layers, introducing more hidden convolutions along with the preprocessing steps described above and the hyperparameters mentioned above, I was able to achieve validation accuracy of 95%.

My final model results were:
* training set accuracy of 95%
* validation set accuracy of 94% 
* test set accuracy of 93%

If an iterative approach was chosen:
* What was the first architecture that was tried and why was it chosen?
I chose the LeNet architecture because it was the first ever attempt at classifying large set of images. It gave 87% accuracy on direct implementation. 

* What were some problems with the initial architecture?

Initial architecture was very good. It gave 87% accuracy in its vanilla implementation. However, with some further preprocessing, I was able to achieve 92-93% validation accuracy. I further tried to improve the score by adding dropout layers with keep probability = 70%.


* How was the architecture adjusted and why was it adjusted? Typical adjustments could include choosing a different model architecture, adding or taking away layers (pooling, dropout, convolution, etc), using an activation function or changing the activation function. One common justification for adjusting an architecture would be due to overfitting or underfitting. A high accuracy on the training set but low accuracy on the validation set indicates over fitting; a low accuracy on both sets indicates under fitting.
* Which parameters were tuned? How were they adjusted and why?
keep probability, epochs, batch sizes were adjusted to get maximum accuracy. It was mostly trial and error method.

* What are some of the important design choices and why were they chosen? For example, why might a convolution layer work well with this problem? How might a dropout layer help with creating a successful model?

If a well known architecture was chosen:
* What architecture was chosen?
* Why did you believe it would be relevant to the traffic sign application?
* How does the final model's accuracy on the training, validation and test set provide evidence that the model is working well?
 

###Test a Model on New Images

####1. Choose five German traffic signs found on the web and provide them in the report. For each image, discuss what quality or qualities might be difficult to classify.

Here are five German traffic signs that I found on the web:

![alt text][image4] ![alt text][image5] ![alt text][image6] 
![alt text][image7] ![alt text][image8]

The first image might be difficult to classify because...


The above chosen cells are downloaded from the internet. They represent ahead-only, slippery-road, right of way at next intersection, stop sign and speed limit (60) respectively. 

- The image of the stop sign also contains grass and sky. This might misclassify the image.
- The similar case can be observed in case of Slippery road. The extra information supplied by the image to the model can make it misclassify the image. 

- Other three images contain plain symbols that are very easy for the model to classify. 

Inorder to fix the above problem, I can generate more data by augmenting the images. This will further increase the test accuracy of the images. 

####2. Discuss the model's predictions on these new traffic signs and compare the results to predicting on the test set. At a minimum, discuss what the predictions were, the accuracy on these new predictions, and compare the accuracy to the accuracy on the test set (OPTIONAL: Discuss the results in more detail as described in the "Stand Out Suggestions" part of the rubric).

Here are the results of the prediction:

| Image			        |     Prediction	        					| 
|:---------------------:|:---------------------------------------------:| 
| Ahead only      		| Ahead only   									| 
| Slippery road 		| Slippery Road 								|
| Right of way   		| Right of way									|
| Stop           		| Stop              			 				|
| Speed limit 60 		| Speed limit 80      							|


The model was able to correctly guess 4 of the 5 traffic signs, which gives an accuracy of 80%. This compares favorably to the accuracy on the test set of images downloaded off the internet.

####3. Describe how certain the model is when predicting on each of the five new images by looking at the softmax probabilities for each prediction. Provide the top 5 softmax probabilities for each image along with the sign type of each probability. (OPTIONAL: as described in the "Stand Out Suggestions" part of the rubric, visualizations can also be provided such as bar charts)

The code for making predictions on my final model is located in the 11th cell of the Ipython notebook.

For the first image, the model is relatively sure that this is a stop sign (probability of 0.6), and the image does contain a stop sign. The top five soft max probabilities were

| Probability         	|     Prediction	        					| 
|:---------------------:|:---------------------------------------------:| 
| 1.0         			| Ahead only  									| 
| 1.0     				| Slippery road 								|
| 1.0					| Right of way									|
| 1.0	      			| Stop       					 				|
| 0.0				    | Speed limit 60      							|


For the second image ... 

### (Optional) Visualizing the Neural Network (See Step 4 of the Ipython notebook for more details)
####1. Discuss the visual output of your trained network's feature maps. What characteristics did the neural network use to make classifications?
